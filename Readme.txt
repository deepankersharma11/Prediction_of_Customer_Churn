 	=============> Prediction of Customer Churn <==============
Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies.
Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies
are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. Therefore, finding factors that
increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. The Objective
is to develop a churn prediction model which assists companies to predict customers who are most
likely subject to churn. We are processing ETL operation on top of that data using Apache Spark and
dumping required data into Mongo Db for data visualization through Tableau and build Machine
Learning for estimating the customer churn rate. Prediction of customer churns help in planning
process and strategic decision making in large companies.
